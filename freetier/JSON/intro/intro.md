# Workshop Introduction and Overview

## Introduction to Oracle JSON Workbook.

JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)is a syntax for storing and exchanging data. When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.

JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.

This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.


**JSON with Oracle Database:**

JSON data  can be used in Oracle Database in similar ways. Unlike relational data, it can be stored, indexed, and queried without any need for a schema that defines the data. Oracle Database supports JSON natively with relational database features, including transactions, indexing, declarative querying, and views.

So it's likely we want to send and receive JSON documents from and to our database. And store them in your tables. Oracle Database has a huge amount of functionality that makes this easy.

The first thing to realize about JSON is that it remains a simple text formatâ€”which is relatively easy to read and inspect with the naked eye. At a syntax level, what starts to set JSON apart from other formats is the characters used to separate data, which are mainly constrained to apostrophes ', brackets ( ), [ ], { }, colons :, and commas ,. This listing illustrates what a JSON payload looks like:
